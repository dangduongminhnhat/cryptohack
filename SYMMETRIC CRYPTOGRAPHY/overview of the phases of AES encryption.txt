Here's an overview of the phases of AES encryption:

1. KeyExpansion or Key Schedule

 From the 128 bit key, 11 separate 128 bit "round keys" are derived: one to be used in each AddRoundKey step.

2. Initial key addition

 AddRoundKey - the bytes of the first round key are XOR'd with the bytes of the state.

3. Round - this phase is looped 10 times, for 9 main rounds plus one "final round"

 a) SubBytes - each byte of the state is substituted for a different byte according to a lookup table ("S-box").

 b) ShiftRows - the last three rows of the state matrix are transposed—shifted over a column or two or three.

 c) MixColumns - matrix multiplication is performed on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column. This is skipped in the final round.

 d) AddRoundKey - the bytes of the current round key are XOR'd with the bytes of the state.
